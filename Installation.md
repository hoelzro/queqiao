# Installing Queqiao

To use Queqiao, you'll need to use a Vim with Lua support
compiled in.  To check for this, run the following command on
the Vim command line:

    :echo has('lua')

If this outputs 1, you have Lua support.

To install Queqiao, you need only copy the plugin/ directory from
the Queqiao source distribution to $HOME/.vim/.
